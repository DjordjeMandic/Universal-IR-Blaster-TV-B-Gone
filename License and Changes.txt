Universal IR Blaster TV-B-Gone V1.5.3:
Default region changed to NA (main.h)
Default code list changed to region codes (SelectedUser = 0)
Wake button (big middle one) now starts transmission of region codes
Left option switch is used now for User1 code selection, middle and right option switch remain untouched.
Boot configuration of left option switch is left untouched.
Holding all option switches and wake button while booting changes region 

Universal IR Blaster TV-B-Gone V1.5.2:
Fixed Number of boots and starts overflow
Added option to write eeprom defaults

Universal IR Blaster TV-B-Gone V1.5.1:
Added LG, D3Mini, Tesla Codes and RCA timings.
Changed sequence of User1 codes.

Universal IR Blaster TV-B-Gone V1.5:

Added option to control brightness of STAT LED in Software PWM mode. (https://github.com/per1234/PalatisSoftPWM)
Added USB Serial Number to EEPROM and Info screen / data query.
Low Battery is now indicated by stat led fading away 2 times from maximum set brightness to off.
Changed default selected user from region codes to User1.
Hardware version mismatch watchdog timeout increased to 2 seconds.
Baud rate increased from 115200 to 1000000(1M) due to error at 115200. No error at 1M on both sides.
Wake button now selects User1 instead of region codes.
Option SW1 + Wake selects region codes.
Option SW2 + Wake selects User2 codes.
Option SW3 + Wake selects User3 codes.
Option SW1 during boot overrides sleep mode. Was debug mode before.
Option SW2 during boot overrides debug mode. Was sleep before.
Added P command used to set PWM value for STAT led.
Added option to specify code id in list to transmit when in N command mode.
Fixed a typo in JSON data formatting.
Added Blueberry TV Power Code to database and to User1 List.
Compiled with MiniCore 2.1.2

Universal IR Blaster TV-B-Gone V1.4:

All other changes will be in changelog somewhere in this project(will be updated)
Default region customisable in main.h
Added few custom codes
Moved EU and NA ir code pointer arrays to respective header files
EEPROM map for Universal IR Blaster V0.2 board added (MAP MUST NOT CHANGE BETWEEN VERSIONS OR BACKWARDS COMPABILITY IS RUINED)
AVcc and IPROG can be measured
delay_ten_us has been changed to use builtin func to delay cycles
Region selection resistor is now a dummy resistor thats currently only used for delay_ten_us calibration during development
Region selection is done in code and eeprom
Multiple 'users' added. They act like regions
WDT protection for IR diodes
Sleep mode can be disabled
Codes are decompressed into ram before emmiting for better timing accuraccy
Added 3 aditional buttons for user input and one pin dedicated to gpio of usb serial converter
Added Serial communication with user for control and information gathering
Firmware only compatibale with Universal IR Blaster V0.2 board
Changed actual use of firmware for Universal IR Blaster V0.2 board
Ported to Universal IR Blaster V0.2 Board
